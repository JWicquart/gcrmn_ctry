### 2.1 Datasets description

The figures and tables presented in this report were made using the seven following datasets:

* **Background maps**. The background maps data of land, minor islands and atolls as 1:10 m shapefiles (v. 4.1.0) were
obtained from [Natural Earth Data (Natural Earth Data, 2018)](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/).

* **Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ)**. The EEZ shapefile (v.11) was obtained from the [Flanders Marine Institute, 2019](https://www.marineregions.org/downloads.php).

* **Coral reefs distribution**. The distribution of coral reefs of the world shapefile was obtained from the WRI (Institute for Marine Remote Sensing - University of South Florida (IMaRS-USF), Institut de Recherche pour le DÃ©veloppement (IRD), UNEP-WCMC, The WorldFish Center, & World Resources Institute, 2011). This dataset was used to ensure consistency with the GCRMN report [Status of Coral Reefs of the World: 2020 (Souter et al., 2021)](https://gcrmn.net/2020-report/), which also uses this dataset.

* **Hard coral species richness**. The number of hard coral species in each country was estimated based on the IUCN Red-List Database (IUCN, 2021).

* **Coral reef fish species richness**. The number of fish species associated with coral reefs in each country was estimated based on the [Fishbase database (Froese & Pauly, 2020)](https://www.fishbase.de/).

* **Marine Protected Areas (MPA)**. Marine Protected Area shapefiles were obtained from the Marine Protection Atlas Database (Marine Conservation Institute, 2020). Marine Protection Atlas uses the World Database on Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC & IUCN, 2020) as the starting point for its database, conducting an independent, third-party review of the data and making additions and corrections if necessary.

* **2020 GCRMN world report database**. The database built for the 2020 GCRMN Report [Status of Coral Reefs of the World: 2020 (Souter et al., 2021)](https://gcrmn.net/2020-report/) was used to describe the monitoring within the different countries. Thousands of raw datasets, provided by numerous contributors worldwide, were homogenized and aggregated based on a dedicated workflow presented in [Wicquart et al, (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954121003344), order to produce a unique and homogeneous database. Variables used in this database are presented in the **Table 1**.

**Table 1.** Variables selected for the benthic synthetic dataset. The icons for the variables categories (`Cat.`) represents :memo: = description variables, :globe_with_meridians: = spatial variables, :calendar: = temporal variables, :straight_ruler: = methodological variables, :crab: = taxonomic variables, :chart_with_upwards_trend: = metric variables.
